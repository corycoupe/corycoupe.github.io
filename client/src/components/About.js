        I'm a web developer always seeking opportunities to grow and learn. My
        passion into technology started with gaming at a young age. I have a
        quiet confidence, and a natural inclination towards learning. Outside of
        coding, I enjoy politics, philosophy, creative writing and gaming. My
        core belief is in helping others and I hope to fulfill that with my
        passion in technology.
